# AI-Project4-Bayes-HMM
In this profect I have used exact inference and approximate inference methods to track down invisible ghosts that gave noisy sensor readings. In approximate inference, I have used particle filter and joint particle filter methods. In exact inference, I have used dynmaic Bayes net and HMMs (Hidden Markov Models).
